# FizzBuzz-in-Tensorflow-and-Keras
**University at Buffalo, CSE574: Introduction to Machine Learning**
Project 1.1 

### Overview
* If an integer is divisible by 3, then the output should be Fizz.
* If the integer divisible by 5 the output should be Buzz.
* An integer divisible by both 3 and 5 should return an output of FizzBuzz.
* If an integer is not divisible by 3 or 5 or 15, it should simply print Other.
